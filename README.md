 MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 14 Challenge

Code file names: 'index.html', 'otudataexplore.js', and 'styles.css'

The code in this repository is for a web-based interactive dashboard that implements D3 and Plotly JavaScript libraries to create and display dynamically updating charts/web elements. This specific webpage allows the user to explore data from a microbial diversity survery of human navels (belly buttons -- see https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). Using this webpage, the user can select an individual study subject from a drop-down box and then four dynamically updating JavaScript-based page elements will display the a set of summary information for that indivudal. The information displayed includes the demographics of the selected indiviudal, a bar chart showing the top 10 most abundant OTUs (and count number) isolated from that individual, the number of times a week that indiviudal washes their navel (self-reported), and a bubble chart showing every OTU isolated from the selected indiviudal and the OTU count numbers. The charts will update each time a new study subject is selected from the drop down box.

*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

I did use a natural language description of the desired code's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help with code syntax. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this particular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.
