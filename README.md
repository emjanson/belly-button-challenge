 MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 14 Challenge

Code file names: '/WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb' and '/WeatherPy/VacationPy.ipynb'


*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

I did use a natural language description of the desired code's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help with code syntax. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this particular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.
